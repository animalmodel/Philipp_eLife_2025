# Code and Data for: Multi-timescale neural adaptation underlying long-term musculoskeletal reorganization

**Authors:** Roland Philipp, et al.
**Journal:** eLife (2025)
**Repository:** [https://github.com/animalmodel/Philipp_eLife_2025](https://github.com/animalmodel/Philipp_eLife_2025)

## Overview
This repository contains the MATLAB analysis scripts used to generate the figures for the manuscript. The code analyzes EMG activity and muscle synergies in non-human primates before and after tendon transfer surgery.

## ?? Data Availability
The dataset (EMG and Synergy matrices) required to run these scripts will be made available via Zenodo/GitHub shortly.

## ?? Installation & Setup
To run these scripts, you must maintain the following folder structure:

1.  Download the `Codes/` folder from this repository.
2.  Place the `Data/` folder (once available) in the same root directory as `Codes/`.
